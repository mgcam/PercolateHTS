PercolateHTS (Percolate High Throughput Sequencing)

A collection of workflows and workflow components for processing
high-throughput short-read DNA sequence data.

We have a number of in-house Percolate workflows wrapping tools such
as Picard, samtools, BWA, TopHat, Cufflinks and other software. In
PercolateHTS I am aiming to collect out the components that do not
rely on our in-house infrastructure.

This is a work in progress. However, the master branch should always
pass all of the tests.

PercolateHTS dependencies are:

- Percolate >= 0.6.0 (http://github.com/keithj/Percolate)


PercolateHTS uses:

- Picard (http://picard.sourceforge.net)
- samtools (http://samtools.sourceforge.net)
- BWA (http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net)
